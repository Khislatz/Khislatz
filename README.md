Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Khislat (Haley). Welcome to my GitHub page!

I am a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer, with a passion for Natural Language Processing, Neural Networks, and Deep Learning. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an application in collaboration with a team of Data Scientists and Web Developers. The app analyzes data from cities such as populations, cost of living, rental rates, crime rates, park (walk score), and many other social and economic factors that are important in deciding where someone would like to live,
